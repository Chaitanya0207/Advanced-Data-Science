## Assignment 2:

## Objective - The main aim is to perform EDA and implement linear regression, decrease the complexity of the model or overfitting by performing ridge regularization, implementing random forest regression, Gradient boosting regression and to determine the best models using step wise regression, multi-colinearity and hyperparameter tuning using MSE, RMSE and R squared as the evaluation metrics.

## Dataset - 

â€¢	This notebook contains data cleaning, visualisation,Linear Regressions, Interaction Effects and Regularization. The dataset considered here is Historical weather of Delhi for year 1997 to 2016 : https://www.kaggle.com/mahirkukreja/delhi-weather-data/data
