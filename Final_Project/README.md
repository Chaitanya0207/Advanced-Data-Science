## Final Project:

## Objective - The main purpose of the project is to evaluate the performance of neural networks on classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) sequences as normal or abnormal. We are designing neural network models using significant hyperparameter tuning to evaluate the performance of the models in classifiying the heart beat sequences as normal or abnormal and as well classifying abnormal heart rate further into 5 multiclass classification.

â€¢	Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat

This dataset is composed of two collections of heartbeat signals derived from two famous datasets in heartbeat classification, 
the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset and The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The number of samples in both collections is large enough for training 
a deep neural network.
